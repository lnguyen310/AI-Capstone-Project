# AI-Capstone-Project
## Description
ScrappyChef is a Python program that helps reduce food waste by suggesting recipes based on ingredients users have at home. It uses AI and natural language processing and query expansions to match ingredients, handle misspellings or synonyms, and rank recipes. The system also provides nutrition information and keeps user data private by processing everything locally.
